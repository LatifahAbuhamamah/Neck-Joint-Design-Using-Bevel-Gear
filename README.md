# Neck-Joint-Design-Using-Bevel-Gear
Here is a summarized overview of the steps involved in designing the neck joint for the robot:

**Step 1: Overview**
- Create a mechanism for the robot's head to move realistically.
- Use servo motors, bevel gears, shaft, U bracket, and servo interface brackets.

**Step 2: Servo Motors**
- Utilize two servo motors for X and Y axes motion.
- Mount them securely with servo interface brackets.

**Step 3: Bevel Gears**
- Incorporate bevel gears to change motion direction.
- Use one assembly for X-axis and another for Y-axis.

**Step 4: Shaft and U Bracket**
- Connect the bevel gear assembly using a shaft.
- Attach a U bracket to hold and support the robot's head.

**Step 5: Motion Control**
- Control servo motors to control head movement.
- Achieve complex neck movements through coordinated servo control.

**Step 6: Considerations**
- Ensure proper alignment of gears, motors, and brackets.
- Lubricate gears and secure attachments for smooth motion.
- Calibrate servo motors and servo horns for accuracy.
